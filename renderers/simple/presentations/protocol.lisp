;;; TODO: The shapes should be able to influence the renderable's "ideal size" as returned
;;;       by the SUGGEST-SIZE function. This is a bit tricky, since some shapes might have
;;;       bounds that are just adaptive, whereas others might have bounds that are restrictive
;;;       and we need to only consider restrictive bounds.

;;; KLUDGE: This is "poisoning" as it injects a class that might not be wanted if other
;;;         systems than presentations are used to perform drawing operations. Ideally
;;;         we'd instead create subclasses of all shapes with our extra stuff as a mixin.
;;;         However, that's a bit troublesome with user-extensions, as those would not
;;;         automatically be presentations-ready.
;;;         
;;;         The same problem exists for renderables, though there it is arguably worse,
;;;         as then the user would always have to use the extra subclasses from presentations
;;;         to construct all their UI, rather than the standard ones from core.
